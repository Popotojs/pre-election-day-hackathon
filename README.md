# pre-election-day-hackathon
Source code of pre-election day hackathon done during @GraphConnect Hackaton [Meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/221364888/).

This web application uses [Popoto.js](http://www.popotojs.com) to visualize Neo4j dataset containing election data.
The visualization have been customized to include a proportional map generated with d3 using code from [electionmap](https://github.com/timcraft/electionmap) project.

A live version of this application with data hosted on GrapheneDB can be found  [here](http://www.popotojs.com/live/uk-general-election/index.html).
